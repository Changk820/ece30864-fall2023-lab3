1a. I think it depends, but in a waterfall methadology, which isn't agile, the equivalent to
a product owner would be the project manager, who is responsible for planning, executing, and closing projects.
Similarly, the product owner in agile methodlogy sets direction for the team, handles release management and stakeholder management.
The only main difference is that the project manager is more structured and sequential in their approach to projects.
