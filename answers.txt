1a. I think it depends, but in a waterfall methadology, which isn't agile, the equivalent to 
a product owner would be the project manager, who is responsible for planning, executing, and closing projects.
Similarly, the product owner in agile methodlogy sets direction for the team, handles release management and stakeholder management.
The only main difference is that the project manager is more structured and sequential in their approach to projects.

1b. The main role of the scrum master is to lead the team in everyday development of the project, and making sure everything flows smoothly.
The scrum master's responsibilties may include holding daily standup meetings, helping to address any obstacles, and help product owner with
creating sprint backlogs
By comparison, the role of the product owner would be more visionary and business oriented. Their main responsibilities incldue working with
the scrum master and business customers/partners to create product backlogs and ensure the product is following the intended vision.
In summary, the scrum master is more everyday technical oriented, while the product owner is more responsible for the overall vision in the long run.

1c.
Sprint planning meeting:
    -Determine what to be completed in upcoming sprint
        ie: -move stories from back log to current sprint
            -assign stories to team members
    -Start the sprint
Daily scrum/standup meeting:
    -Discuss daily tasks to be completed and tasks completed so far
    -Report any obstacles and potentially discuss fixes to overcome said obstacles
Sprint retrospective meeting:
    -Discuss work completed and move incomplete work to backlog
    -Discuss any shortcomings and possible improvements to team,
     as well as acknowledging any team members who went above and beyond
